<h1> Blurs </h1>

Blurring is one of the most important pre-processing applications in image processing.

<h2> Usage </h2>

- In general, blurring is employed to process the image if we are interested in the <em> structural properties </em> of an image.
- In tandem, the image is also generally converted to grayscale so as to save memory by dropping color information (and since that doesn't exactly affect structural information in the image)

<h2> Kernels </h2>
 
 - Kernels are small matrices designed to slide across the length and width of the image, anchoring their centres at each pixel of the image and doing a required calculation
 - **Convolution** with kernels denotes element-wise multiplication and addition to replace the value of the pixel at the centre. This is what happens in kernel-based blurring.
 -  Kernels can also be simply used to test
